How come Apple is totally out of the AI race?,"Looks like they never even participated in the first place, meanwhile we have all those other trillion-dollar companies fighting for years to becoming the biggest and greatest in this race, and they're using it for everything Cloud, jobs etc.. not just photoshopping people away in pictures, the stock is barely moving at all while the other ones had their big run when they introduced that they're heavily invested into AI.. Alphabet, MSFT, META..",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oev266/how_come_apple_is_totally_out_of_the_ai_race/,2025-10-24T11:21:15Z,613,506,stocks

Semi annual Apple event,"Any word on if we’ll have an upcoming Apple event/multiplier in November? (CSP: 1.25x & CSR: 1.5x)

I referred someone to a CSP a few weeks ago, they just met their spend limit and got their SUB. I’m hoping mine will post in time for that forthcoming event…

(inb4 people suggesting to transfer points to other travel partners, I’m good thanks…)

TIA!

Just how bad is Apple for privacy?,"I’m new to the privacy scene. I started recently by getting involved with Linux mint because of the change with Windows11 that I despise. It honestly got me wondering about smartphone security also as I’ve been hearing some pretty terrible things about Apple as of late. I’ve heard they’ve been diving more and more into AI and they also recently came close to selling the data of UK residents to the government. Was just wondering how bad their products are for actual security. Have been an Apple product user for almost 15 years now but I’m willing to make a switch immediately for security/privacy purposes. 

If it’s just completely terrible could you please offer some smartphone alternatives? I’m not so gung ho about privacy that I’d want like a Nokia brick etc, I would still like a smartphone however just a more secure one.
